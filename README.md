# Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that serve as tutorials in Polish for performing image segmentation and image classification using PyTorch. The tutorials guide you through the process of loading datasets, defining and training models, and creating interactive interfaces with Gradio.

# Notebooks
 - Image Segmentation with DeepLabV3 on VOCSegmentation Dataset
 - Image Classification with Custom CNN and ResNet-18 on Caltech101 Dataset
## 1. Image Segmentation with DeepLabV3 on VOCSegmentation Dataset
This notebook demonstrates how to use a pre-trained DeepLabV3 model for image segmentation on the VOCSegmentation dataset. The tutorial covers the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries
Defining data transformations and loading the dataset
Setting up the pre-trained DeepLabV3 model
Training the model
Saving the trained model
Loading the trained model and performing image segmentation
Creating an interactive interface with Gradio

## 2. Image Classification with Custom CNN and ResNet-18 on Caltech101 Dataset
This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a custom CNN and fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-18 model for image classification on the Caltech101 dataset. The tutorial covers the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries
Defining data transformations and loading the dataset
Creating a custom CNN model
Loading and modifying a pre-trained ResNet-18 model
Defining loss functions and optimizers
Training both models
Saving the trained ResNet-18 model
Loading the trained model and creating an interactive interface with Gradio
